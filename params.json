This service is focused on receiving a request to store Timeseries Data and sending it to the Timeseries service.  It is part of the Data Ingestion Pipeline where a lookup is performed for an AssetId, accessing metadata about each Timeseries Tag.  The metadata will hold the required info needed to post the data to the Predix Timeseries database.\r\n\r\n###Ingestion Flow\r\nData Flows from the MachineDataSimulator or a physical Asset via Predix Machine to the HTTP-DataRiverReceiver in the cloud.  The Timeseries Ingester takes over from there, looks up the Asset Tag meta-info which provides the info needed to post the data to the Predix Timeseries service.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src='images/RefApp-IngestionFlow.png' >\r\n\r\n##Asset Model\r\nThis service is part of the Predix Reference App.  Since Predix Asset comes with an empty database, the Reference App creates a data 'model' depicted below, which sets up entities and attributes for Groups, Classifications, Assets and Tags.\r\n\r\n<img src=images/AssetModel.png width=1200 height=600>\r\n\r\nThe model has these characteristics:\r\n- A Turbine, for example,  is Modeled as a Classification\r\n- (future)A Device, such as a Honeywell Controller, is modeled as a Classification\r\n- A Device is hooked to Predix Machine and a data Node retrieves data using an Adapter.  \r\n- A Predix Machine can talk to many Devices on many Industrial Machines\r\n- A Tag represents a Timeseries Data parameter, either raw sensor data or calculated data\r\n- (future)A DeviceAsset is an instance of a Device classification and has DeviceTag instance attributes\r\n- An AssetGroup can be a location (Site,Plant,etc) or an entity(Enterprise,City,County) that logically holds a set of Assets\r\n- An Asset is an instance of a Classification and has singleValue Attributes as well as AssetTag instance attributes\r\n- AssetTag knows of it's Unit of Measure and also has a key to several Datasources\r\nDeviceTag ID\r\nNode ID\r\nTimeseries Tag ID\r\n- (future)A Field further describes any Attribute for purposes such as DataIngestion, UI, DataBinding for FederatedQuery, Analytics\r\n- (future)A Field has a FieldSource that describes how or where the data is stored for an Attribute\r\n- (future)A Field has a FieldStrategy Handler uri that knows how to retrieve or store data from/to a FieldSource\r\n- (future)A MachineAsset is be modeled to navigate from the Machine Id to the Devices and Assets\r\n\r\n##Tech Stack\r\n- Spring\r\n- SpringBoot\r\n- SpringTest\r\n- Maven\r\n\r\n##Microcomponents\r\n- [AssetBootstrap](https://github.com/PredixDev/asset-bootstrap)\r\n- [TimeseriesBootstrap](https://github.com/predixdev/timeseries-bootstrap)\r\n- [PredixMicroserviceTemplates](https://github.com/predixdev/predix-microservice-templates)\r\n- [PredixRestClient](https://github.com/predixdev/predix-rest-client)\r\n\r\n### More Details\r\n* [More GE resources](https://github.com/PredixDev/predix-rmd-ref-app/blob/master/docs/resources.md)\r\n* [RMD Reference App](http://github.com/predixdev/predix-rmd-ref-app)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
